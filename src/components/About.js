            <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                My career has been about tackling hard technical problems. Hard technical problems require a profound understanding of the underlying science and an absolute willingness to learn and develop the next generation of tools. That\'s why I love leading large and diverse teams. Diverse teams produce rich solutions and bring a multitude of tools to bear. My special leadership ability is to "catch on quick". I am very skilled at listening to members of my team and learning the expertise they bring. Oftentimes that expertise is veiled in a solution to a small technical problem - technical leadership is about posing challenges that explore the depth of possible solutions. Engaged management and committed direction is the key to successful recruitment and an absolute necessity for retainment.

I have dedicated my career to advancing scientific innovation and tackling complex challenges in the field of biotechnology. As a staff member and manager at Sandia National Laboratories, I have led numerous high-impact projects involving cutting-edge technologies. I have also applied machine learning, advanced algorithms and artificial intelligence to significant biological, computational and genomics problems. My work has resulted in 30 peer-reviewed publications and numerous presentations at prestigious conferences, showcasing my commitment to advancing our understanding of genomics, computational biology and biosecurity.

My role as a Program Manager at DARPA and my leadership and management positions at Sandia National Laboratories have equipped me with the skills to manage complex projects, develop innovative technologies, and foster collaborative research efforts. I have successfully led teams of computational and experimental biologists, driving forward initiatives that integrate advanced algorithms, secure computation, and machine learning to enhance the cybersecurity of biological operations and generate novel biological insights. These solutions have never been restricted to one disipline, but more often than not crossed numerous fields.

I am passionate about mentoring and developing the careers of talented scientists and researchers. My leadership philosophy centers on fostering a collaborative and inclusive work environment, where diverse perspectives are valued and innovation thrives. I have built strong relationships with industry, government, academia, and other national laboratories, facilitating cross-functional collaborations that drive scientific progress. My strong communication skills enable me to effectively convey complex scientific concepts to diverse audiences, making me a valuable asset to any team dedicated to pushing the boundaries of functional genomics, AI, computational biology and biosecurity.
